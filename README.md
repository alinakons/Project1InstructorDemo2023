# Project1InstructorDemo2023
This is a demo of the Comp490/Comp530 project 

It is current as of sprint 2 for the undergraduates and Graduate Students

This solution works on my form:
https://jsantore.wufoo.com/forms/cubes-project-proposal-submission/

You may have to change it to work with yours.

##Undergraduates 

You need These files (most of the requirements.txt is for the grad students, you only need requests in there)
- getData.py
- msin.py
- DatabaseStuff.py
- and the tests in testSprint2.py
run the demo by running main.py

##Graduate Students
You need all the files from the undergraduate version and
- serverDB.py
- cubes-api.py

To run the server run
-  uvicorn cubes-api:app --reload
